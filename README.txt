This is a very experimental, buggy and absolutely not production-ready prototype of an RTS game in Unity.

I hereby release the code into the public domain. Feel free to use it as you wish. Just don't learn from it,
because I have done a lot of stupid things to cut development time.

If you don't want to build the code, you can take a look at the "gameplay" of this prototype on YouTube:
